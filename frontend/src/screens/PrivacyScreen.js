        By purchasing music sold by Karu, you automatically become bound to the
        terms of the License Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        All music is sold on a non-exclusive license unless otherwise specified
      </p>
      <h5 className="py-3">
        <strong>Terms and Conditions are as follows:</strong>
      </h5>
      <p>
        1. The musical compositions sold by Karu remain the property Karu and
        are licensed, NOT SOLD, to you for use in your musical, artistic,
        business and multimedia efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. The Standard lease includes an encoded MP3 file of the untagged song.
        Upon confirmation of payment, the song file(s) will be provided via a
        download page. Standard Lease allows you to use the beat (or song) for
        ONE commercial recording or broadcast. This recording can then be
        distributed at your price for up to 2,000 copies
      </p>
      <p>
        3. A right to use Karu's music is granted to the original end-user of
        the product (Licensee/Buyer) and is NOT transferable. This license
        grants Licensee the non-exclusive right to use Karu's music so long as
        credit is given where appropriate to Karu's and the relevant producer.
        Karu's (Licensor/Seller) will not receive a royalty from the sale of
        records or downloads. You must however give full credit to the producer
        and/or artist
      </p>
      <p>
        4. It is specifically understood and agreed that Licensee does not
        acquire any ownership rights or any underlying copyrights, and that
        Licensor retains all rights, title and interest in the music obtained
        from Karu, including all copyrights belonging to the original copyright
        holder, as well as any modifications or improvements made to the
        licensed property by Licensee.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. The License expressly FORBIDS resale or other distribution of Karu's
        compositions, either as they exist OR any modification thereof. You
        CANNOT sell, loan, rent, lease, assign, or transfer all OR any of the
        products sold under Beats Planet to another user, or for use in any
        competitive product.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. This document serves as the standing agreement between you and Karu.
        In the event that someone buys exclusive rights to the beat you have
        leased, your rights shall stand and the beat is still yours to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. Leasing rights can be re-sold to more than one client. Upon
        purchasing leasing rights, the seller still owns the beat(s) and the
        seller is able to resell the beat(s) to any other party until exclusive
        rights have been purchased.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. Licensee agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Licensor harmless from
        any and all actions, causes of action, claims, demands, costs,
        liabilities, expenses and damages (including attorneysâ€™ fees) arising
        out of or in connection with any claim that the Tracks furnished by
